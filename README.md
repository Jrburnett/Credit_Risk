# Credit_Risk
Comparing credit risk
In this project I created we use a logistic regression model to compare two versions of a data set in order to create a risk analysis or the target audiences credit risk.
The first step in this project is preparing and splitting the data into training data and testing data.
I then created a logistic regression model with the orginal data, followed by predicted the data with a logistic regression model and resampling and training the data.
After all the data has been predicted and analyzed we created a report of the project listed in the report_template.
